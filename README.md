# onair

Publish to MQTT topics when a Mac's FaceTime camera is activated/deactivated.
This makes it simple to trigger home automation scenes when the camera is live,
e.g. setting a particular lighting environment or switching on an "ON AIR" sign.

## Installation

Depends on [OverSight](https://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html) installed
and configured to log webcam activity to a file.
