# onair

Publish to MQTT topics when a Mac's FaceTime camera is activated/deactivated.
This makes it simple to trigger home automation scenes when the camera is live,
e.g. setting a particular lighting environment or switching on an "ON AIR" sign.

## Installation

The camera detection code is run as a little Objective-C helper, so build that by running `make`.
